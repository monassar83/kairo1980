/* Telling the restaurant that money arrived.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The order and the money have always travelled by different paths. The money
   is taken server-side and confirmed by a signed webhook, so it cannot go
   missing. The ORDER is composed in the guest's own browser and handed to
   WhatsApp by the guest — which means a guest who pays and then closes the tab
   has bought food nobody has been told to cook. That happened, with a real
   customer, and it was only noticed because the restaurant happened to look at
   /admin.

   So this sends the order from the one place that already knows the money is
   real: the transition to `captured`. Not from the browser — the browser is
   exactly the party that may have already gone.

   WHAT IT DOES NOT DO is as important as what it does. It carries no name, no
   phone number and no address, because the server has never held any: see
   migrations/0001_payments.sql. It sends the reference, what was ordered, what
   it cost, and where it is going as a postcode. That is enough to recognise the
   order when the guest rings up, and it keeps this change clear of the privacy
   rewrite that delivering the FULL order server-side would require (a retention
   period, Meta as a processor, § 312i BGB). See docs/next-whatsapp-cloud-api.md
   — this is step 1 of that plan, running in parallel with the guest's own
   handover, and it is deliberately the cheap half.

   Telegram rather than WhatsApp for now because WhatsApp's Cloud API cannot use
   a number that is signed in to the WhatsApp Business App, and that app is the
   one the restaurant actually watches. Moving the number would take the shop
   off the app it runs on. A second number and an approved template are the
   proper answer and are days of Meta onboarding; this is minutes, and the hole
   is open tonight.

   UNCONFIGURED IS OFF, not broken. With no token the site behaves exactly as it
   did before — the same call the admin area makes, for the same reason: a lock
   nobody has set up is not an unlocked door. */
