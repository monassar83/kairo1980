/* The restaurant's clock.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Every date this server reasons about is a date in Hockenheim, not a date in
   UTC and not a date wherever the isolate happens to be running. "Tomorrow"
   means tomorrow in the shop.

   No library. The trick throughout is that `toLocaleString('sv-SE')` prints a
   wall clock in a chosen zone in a format `Date.parse` can read back, which is
   enough to recover the zone's offset at any instant — including across the
   two Sundays a year when it changes. */
